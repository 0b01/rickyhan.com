I will use textsynth.org to generate the rest:

I am interested in technology, programming, and computer security. I've used Python at work and I'm comfortable using a programming language as the primary means of communication, but I am also willing to learn other languages as they become available.


I have experience with C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, ASP.NET, Jquery, jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, React, and Angular2. I am more interested in working on a large project that needs to be able handle large amounts of data.


In general I am a person that likes to have fun, and is passionate about using technology as efficiently as possible. I enjoy working with people and would like to learn new programming languages. I appreciate a positive work environment, and I would prefer to work remotely. I value the ability to work across multiple teams in a high-energy, creative, and collaborative environment.


I also enjoy spending time with my family and the outdoors, including cycling, swimming, hiking, and camping. I believe in being able to do things without feeling like I'm being judged, and feel comfortable working in a team environment. I love solving challenging problems in the real world, and would like to develop an interest for solving challenging problems for the Internet.


I believe in a fair and transparent process for decisions as well as fair and transparent feedback from the people we are developing software for.


I am happy to meet with potential co-workers and discuss how I can best solve their problems.
