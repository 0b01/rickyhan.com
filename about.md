I am a software developer with experience in programming. I'm interested in trading systems, machine learning, functional programming and compiler development.

Please add me on LinkedIn and checkout my code on GitHub.

I will use textsynth.org to generate the rest.

I want:


a) An interactive text synthesis engine based on the Haskell programming language with a focus on Haskell bindings and other Haskell-related software libraries. The code will be written in Haskell and be used as an input source to the engine. I will use my knowledge and experience in Haskell to develop the engine in Haskell.

b) A library of Haskell bindings or other Haskell-related software libraries.

c) A collection of Haskell libraries.

d) A collection of Haskell libraries that work as Haskell services, and that can be run as a Haskell service that provides a RESTful interface.


e) A library for creating interactive Haskell services.


Focuses are: (1) the development of Haskell bindings or other Haskell-oriented software libraries and (2) development of a Haskell-based, RESTful, Haskell service that provides a RESTful interface, and that has a Haskell backend.


My first step will be to create the Haskell bindings, and then develop the code in Haskell. I'm not trying to develop a whole system. I'm mainly interested in producing an engine that can serve as a starting point for building other solutions.


The code should be reasonably small because I'm not going to put in a lot of effort in it. It does not have to be a production project that gets used in production. It's mostly intended to be a starting block for future ideas.


The Haskell engine should be able to serve a RESTful interface for the service and provide a Haskell backend that works with the RESTful interface. The engine should also be able to serve other services. If you don't know about Haskell, I'd suggest reading this tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDYx5zQ2w6w .


This is my first project for the new language Haskell, and I'm very interested in getting the hang of it.
