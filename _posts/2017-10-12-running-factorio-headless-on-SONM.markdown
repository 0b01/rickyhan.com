In this short post, I will test out SONM.

SONM is a decentralized cloud provider. In this case, cloud is just someone else's computer literally. I read on the website that this is called "fog computing." In essense, anyone can become a "miner" to run application in exchange for SONM tokens. The technology is enabled by Docker, Yandex Cocaine and its own network discovery module(insomnia) and a blockchain interface. There are two binaries: hub for discovery(presumably one for a computing cluster) and miner to run on each host machine, both written in Go. I'd like to think of SONM as Kubernetes on a blockchain.

To test the project at its current stage, I will deploy a Factorio docker server and judge by the ease of use for both sysadmin and end user.

# Installing SONM Toolbelt

Following alpha release [the tutorial](https://sonm.io/alpha-release/) step by step, I downloaded the 0.2.1 release from [Github](https://github.com/sonm-io/core/releases).

    $ ./sonmhub

Then in a separate session,

    $ sudo ./sonmminer

I assume that one hub supports a cluster of nearby hosts, similar to the master node on Kubernetes.

Finally, to run a docker container, create a yml file:

    $ cat > task.yml <<END
    > task:
    >   container:
    >     name: dtandersen/factorio:latest 
    >   resources:
    >       CPU: 1
    >       RAM: 10240kb
    >END

Now we need to figure out the miner on which to run the task:

    $ ./sonmcli --addr 127.0.0.1:10001 miner list
    Miner: 127.0.0.1:50928          Idle

    $ ./sonmcli --addr 127.0.0.1:10001 miner status 127.0.0.1:50928
    Miner: "127.0.0.1:50928" (003fe205-af29-4777-aa2c-a70fd50569ab):
    Hardware:
        CPU0: 1 x QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.2.1
        GPU: None
        RAM:
        Total: 992.6 MB
        Used:  463.5 MB
    No active tasks

Now we can deploy the task:

    $ ./sonmcli --addr 127.0.0.1:10001 task start 127.0.0.1:50320 task.yml
    Starting "dtandersen/factorio:latest" on miner 127.0.0.1:50928...
    ID 94b59103-0c43-4c1e-bc87-9e06abf39ad5
    Endpoint [27015/tcp->207.244.97.166:32772 34197/udp->207.244.97.166:32769]

This command returns when the task is deployed.

We inspect the miner again:

    $ ./sonmcli --addr 127.0.0.1:10001 miner status 127.0.0.1:50928
    Miner: "127.0.0.1:50928" (003fe205-af29-4777-aa2c-a70fd50569ab):
    Hardware:
        CPU0: 1 x QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.2.1
        GPU: None
        RAM:
        Total: 992.6 MB
        Used:  463.5 MB
    Tasks:
        1) 94b59103-0c43-4c1e-bc87-9e06abf39ad5

The entire process took less than 3 minutes in wall clock time.

Of course, a system this complex will have lots of edge cases. I hope the SONM team have solutions to these pressing issues with fog computing:

1. Security: user side and miner side

2. Proof of execution

3. Dishonest nodes

4. GPU tasks - SONM will support OpenCL but what about `nvidia-docker` required to run TensorFlow?

SONM marketplace release is scheduled this winter along with a wallet prototype. Here is a diagram of how it works:

I will test these products as they are released.
