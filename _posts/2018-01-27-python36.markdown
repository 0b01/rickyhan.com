Like many, my first programming language is Python 2.7. This year, I decided to make the switch `alias python=python3.6`. Other than a 10% increase in processing speed, it has some perks not previously possible in 2.7.

In this post, I will publish a minimal, complete, and verifiable example of a trading script implemented in Python 3.6.

## Async Generators: what are those?

Suppose we have a stream that generates a bunch of values required by other parts of the program. With `asyncio`, the stream processing loop is run concurrently so it doesn't block.

An example program does the following:
1. Receives a batch of data from stream
2. Do something with the batch of data every x seconds

We start with receiving data. This is an async generator:

```python
import asyncio
from tectonic import TectonicDB
import json
async def subscribe(name):
    db = TectonicDB(host="localhost", port=9001)
    _success, _text = await db.subscribe(name)
    while 1:
        _, text = await db.poll()
        if b"NONE" == text:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.001)
        else:
            yield json.loads(text)
```

As we can see, `subscribe` connects to a TectonicDB instance and subscribes to a data store then polls forever. This coroutine yields new order book updates as they come in.

Next, we define a structure to store this data.

```python
class TickBatcher(object):
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.one_batch = []
        self.db_name = db_name

    async def sub(self):
        async for item in subscribe(self.db_name):
            self.one_batch.append(item)
```

Now since the generator is async, the iteration must also async. So as new data is generated, we append to a list and store as a class variable.

Finally, we define a timer coroutine.

```python
def timer(secs=1):
    """async timer decorator"""
    def _timer(f):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            while 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(s)
                await f()
        return wrapper
    return _timer

class TickBatcher(object):
    ...
    @timer(secs=10)
    async def run(self):
        # do work here
        print(len(self.one_batch))
        self.one_batch = []
```

We use a decorator to hide the sleeping logic.

Finally, to run the program create separate tasks and everything works nicely together.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    proc = TickBatcher("bnc_xrp_btc")
    loop.create_task(proc.sub())
    loop.create_task(proc.run())

    loop.run_forever()
    loop.close()
```

## Conclusion

In this short post we use Python3.6 async generators to implement a simple script to monitor market or place simple orders.
