Xprite is a new program I am developing on and off(mostly off). It is an innovative pixel art editor with a bunch of cool algorithms. Most functionalities are unimplemented but the algorithms are done.

# Removing jaggies

Jaggies are the out of place pixels in a curve.

Currently, in order to draw a perfect curve, a pixel artist has to put in the herculean effort of planning the slope of each segments and painstakingly brush them in one by one.

My algorithm basically sorts the curve segments by slope during the rasterization step. Note this only applies to monotonically increasing/decreasing curves. So a more complex curve shape(sine wave) is destructured into a bunch of monotonic cubic beziers that share adjacent control points.

I am including the algorithm in its entirety. Please share it around if you find it useful.

I originally used WebAssembly + HTML canvas for frontend which is a terrible choice since the browser just can't up with the mouse movements. Recently, I ditched the web part and rewrote the UI in Dear ImGui and it's about 1000x faster. However, I separated out the renderer into its own trait so hopefully web support is still a possibility once the native app is done.
