Xprite is a new program I am developing on and off(mostly off). It is an innovative pixel art editor with a bunch of cool algorithms. Most functionalities are unimplemented but the algorithms are done. In this post I will demo some of them.

# Removing jaggies

<div style="background: azure;">
<style>
    #canvas {
        cursor: none;
        height: 600px;
        width: 600px;
        border: 1px solid blue;
    }
</style>
<canvas id="canvas" width="600" height="600"> </canvas>
<script>
    setTimeout( function() {
        xprite.change_tool("pencil");
        xprite.set_option_for_tool("pencil", "simplify", "false");
    }, 100);
</script>
<script src="/static/pixelart/xprite.js"></script>
</div>

Jaggies

The front end is webassembly + HTML canvas which is a terrible choice. I put GUI development on pause because I want to rework the GUI.
